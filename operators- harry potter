Having crossed the three-headed faun, Harry, Dumbledore, and Snape went through a secret trap door
in search of the Sorcerer's tomb. On the way, they passed through a room and found that the room has only
one door opposite to them, and the door through which they entered shut once they entered the room.
The door was very large with a four-digit number imprinted on it. When Harry and Dumbledore tried to open
it by casting out spells, it didn't open. Having tried various spells, both got fed up and left the task to 
Snape. Snape curiously observing the room found that a statement was written on the top of the room. It was 
written as follows "I will be always four" “I can only be opened when you add my first and last digit and
enter it” and “If you find a sign, you should not consider it” help Snape break the code and open the door 
so that they can save the Sorcerer's tomb.
