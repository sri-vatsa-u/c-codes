Joey Tribbiani wanted to buy a meatball Sandwich and went to the nearby sandwich shop. There was a poster 
that said if anyone comes up with a program for Trendy Number they can get free Sandwiches for a lifetime 
as a gift. Can you help Joey to write a program to check whether the given number is a trendy number or not?

A number is said to be a trendy number if it has 3 digits and the middle digit is divisible by 3.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {

    int n;
    int digit1, digit2, digit3;

    scanf("%d", &n);

    if (n < 100 || n > 999) {
        printf("Invalid Number\n");
    } else {
        
        digit1 = n % 10;        
        digit2 = (n / 10) % 10; 
        digit3 = n / 100;       

        
        if (digit2 % 3 == 0) {
            printf("Trendy Number\n");
        } else {
            printf("Not a Trendy Number\n");
        }
    }


    
    return 0;
}
